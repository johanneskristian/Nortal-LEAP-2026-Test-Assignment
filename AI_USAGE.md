# AI Usage

Briefly describe how you used AI (tools, prompts, code snippets, fixes). Be concise and honest (using AI is fine; it's just a tool; we want to know your method). If you did not use AI, state that here.

I had half of the logic written to prevent direct borrowing when a book is reserved, but I struggled to complete the logic that checks whether the user is first in the reservation queue. 
I used AI to ask how to determine if a user is first in the queue. AI’s answer did not match my implementation, but it helped me understand how to access the reservation list and compare the first entry with the user ID.
